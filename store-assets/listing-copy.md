Adyen Web Inspector

## Summary (<= 132 chars)

Inspect Adyen Web integrations for configuration issues, risky patterns, and clear remediation steps.

## Description

Adyen Web Inspector is an independent Chrome extension for reviewing Adyen Web Drop-in and Components integrations directly in the browser.

Use it to catch client-side implementation issues before release, during merchant reviews, or while troubleshooting checkout problems.

Key capabilities:

• Detects implementation signals such as SDK version, environment, and integration type
• Runs focused checks across setup quality, callbacks, authentication, security signals, and third-party script hygiene
• Highlights issues with actionable remediation guidance and an overall health score
• Exports findings as JSON or PDF for sharing and triage

Important: This is an independent developer tool and is not an official Adyen product. It reviews client-side integration signals only and does not inspect backend API calls.
